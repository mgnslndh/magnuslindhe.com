Yesterday I attended nForum together with some colleagues from AcobiaFLUX. [Adam Lith](https://twitter.com/adamlith) from [Squeed](http://www.squeed.com/) made an interesting presentation about how to protect passwords. Read my [summary in Swedish about the advice](http://automationsbloggen.acobiaflux.se/hur-skyddar-man-losenord-fran-en-hacker/ "How to protect passwords (in Swedish)") we got from Adam.
